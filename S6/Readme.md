We have used the code in previous session for this session. 4 versions of the code have been implemented. 

1)	No loss

2)	L1 loss value

3)	L2 Loss value

4)	L1 + L2 loss value


Observations

•	Without any loss functions the code ran for 40 epochs and the best value of loss obtained was ~0.07

•	L1 loss value seemed to be diminishing well. Though more iterations through different loss values can give us better results

•	Out of all the loss functions used we got L1 as the best one.

•	L2 loss, the values seems to be spiking up and down. Values were taken as 5,0.5.0.05,0.005 and finally decided on 0.00003 value but still the peaks are observed.

•	For both L1 and L2 loss implementation the values seem to steadyily moving across though our intuition says that the values might have to be lesser. 

•	In real world applications mostly L2 are used. 


Lessons learnt

•	Colab Crashes!

•	Start earlier always.

•	Work better and split the work among your team.

•	Whatever work is to be done always think about how to optimize each part of the code.

•	The first step is always the hardest so start early and hard.
